# How to Develop Good Habits

Years and years of failing gets no one anywhere, but year of trying at least gives a person a myriad of skills and a few consolation prizes.

So here is what I’ve learned about how to build a habit.

Personal Favorite:
    - Consistency is key, it’s much easier to keep up the 15th day of a habit than the 1st day. If you miss 1 day, it becomes incredibly likely to miss the 2nd day. “Don’t break the chain” - Jerry Seinfeld

From the book __The Power of Habit__:
    - It’s difficult to create new habits and it’s much easier to curb new habits
    - Habits have a trigger and identifying what your triggers are is vital for avoiding poor habits
    - For each trigger there is a reward mechanism which can be “hacked” to instead get you a more positive return
Example: It’s hard to just start a habit of eating healthy. You remember that you always seem to eat the free donuts at work. At first you think that you are fat and hungry and that’s the reason why you eat donuts every day. But you decide to try something new. When you had the urge to go eat a donut you instead spend some time chatting with a coworker. After chatting with your coworker, you find that you no longer crave the donut. And from that, you change your poor habit into one that’s positive.

From a book called __Habit Stacking__:
    - Motivation is a myth, and is something people shouldn’t wait for to get something done.
    - Small habits are easier to create than large habits. Keeping tasks atomic, and less than 5 minutes in lengths gets rid of many of excuses.
    - Habits should be anchored to tasks you do without fail, i.e. packing gym clothes before you put on your morning clothes.
    - Habits can be chained together to ensure success.  I.e. packing gym clothes, checking the weather, going to the gym after work.
    - These small habits can really add up and make a huge difference in your life
    - Elephant tasks, i.e. writing a program, can be tackled by slowly making progress. To accomplish an elephant task, you can habit stack to ensure you pick at the task until it’s complete. Eventually the task will be finished!

Various other sources:
    - If you tend to never get any work done in your bedroom… find somewhere else to work.  i.e. I got into the habit of goofing off at a local library. It was imperative that I moved somewhere else to reestablish a safe work space.

So those are a few tidbits of advice I’ve learned over the years. Hopefully a tidbit or two of that advice will help you out in the future.
