# 8 git Commands I Show Every Beginner

“Those who fail to remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” - George Santayana

```
git clone "https://github.com/jeffery-do/jeffery-do.github.io.git" #clone the repo to use
git pull # update your code(for this master branch)
git branch -b "branchName" # create a new branch to work from
git checkout "branchName" # go to the branch
git add ./path/to_file.md # add your changes
git commit -m "fixed to_file.md inf loop bug" # bundle your changes under a message
git push origin branchName # push your bundle(commits) to be accessible on the branch
git checkout master # go back to master
```

Now check out your github repo somewhere like here:
https://github.com/jeffery-do/jeffery-do.github.io
If you recently pushed, you should be able to see something like this:
![recently pushed branch image](images/recently_pushed_branch.png)
From there, you should be able to create a PR.

After creating a PR, other people can see your code and comment on your PR.

At any point after you've pushed your branch, people can view branch, and commit their own code to it.
Once everything is nice and tidy, all the commits can be merged with master.
Once the commits have been merged with master, everyone will be able to pull those commits from master.


And that's it! After all that your code is now widely accesible, recoverable, usable, and much more!

# BONUS COMMAND PIPELINES
Here are two bonus pipelines that I use all the time.
Hopefully this will show you how simple git usually is.

### if you need to make changes:
```
git checkout "branchName" # go to your branch
git pull # get any code changes
git add ./path/to_file.md # add your changed
git commit -m "fixed typo" # bundle your changes under a message
git push origin branchName # push your bundle(commits) to be accessible on the branch
```

### and the process continues
```
git checkout master # go to the master branch
git pull # update your code(for this master branch)
git branch "branchName2" # Make a new branch
git checkout branchName2 # Go to the new branch
git add ... # making changes...
```
