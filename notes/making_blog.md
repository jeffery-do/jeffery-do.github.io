## How I made this blog

# Setup
I first followed:
- [Getting Started with Github Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)

After that I got my site up and running at my domain:
[dataontherocks](https://jeffery-do.github.io/)

I wanted a better theme so I looked here:
- [Adding a Jekyll theme to your GitHub Pages site](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site/)

But I'm not familiar with Ruby, so I didn't know what a Gemfile was.
I decided to look at this:
- [What is a Gemfile](http://tosbourn.com/what-is-the-gemfile/)

Humm, it looks like I need to install bundler, and jekell to get the control that I want.
- [Setting up your GitHub PAges site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)

Since I use Macos, I had to refer to this to update Ruby:
Oh, and additionally while installing bundler, apparently it required a newer version of bash:
- [Related Github Issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/5799)
- [Setup Ruby On Rails on macOS 10.12 Sierra](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.12-sierra) I actually didn't set up Rails here. I added rbenv, and set my global ruby to 2.4.0..
