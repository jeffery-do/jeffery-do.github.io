Heyoooooo internet go-er. This is Jeffery Do, and welcome to my blog's github repository.
I'm a strappy lad who loves programming, data, investing, productivity, and processes.
You'll probably see quite a bit of the above topics within this blog, so keep an eye out
if you are interested in my musing.
If you like what you've read, feel free to send me an email. I'd love to hear
some feedback, potential blog topics, or strike up an interesting conversation.

Anyhow, I hope you have a good rest of your morning or afternoon, or night!
